## Analyzing North Carolina's public health data

This repository includes a notebook with information on using Python, Pandas and compiling data. Additionally, it includes compiled data about North Carolina’s public health data.  

- The main County Health Data was downloaded as a CSV file from Professor Gotzler’s ENGL 105 site. The North Carolina Data Subset was compiled using Python, layed out in the notebook.  

- This repository is valuable for anyone interested in public health analysis, particularly in the context of North Carolina. It provides an accessible way to explore and analyze public health data using Python. It is especially useful for those looking to replicate the data compilation process or for researchers and analysts studying health trends in North Carolina. The visualizations and analyses can help identify health inequities and inform decisions for statewide health improvements.

- To get started, users can download the dataset (in CSV format) and open it in a Google Colab notebook. The included notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to import and manipulate the data using Python and Pandas. No advanced Python skills are necessary, but familiarity with Python basics will help users understand and modify the analysis.
- Users can get help by opening an issue in the repository’s Issues tab or by commenting through a pull request. For general inquiries or troubleshooting, users are encouraged to reach out via these channels, where they can receive support from the repository maintainers or the community.

- This repository is maintained by Abby Rosenkrantz, any user may contribute!

The following image represents the amount of premature deaths in NC Counties. This analysis can help show which counties have weaknesses, and where state wide improvements are necessary.
